## Title: <!--Title of your addition-->

<!-- uppercase, underscore_connected name of your module, that you use to mark files-->
MODULE ID: TGUIPLAYERPANEL 

### Description:
This PR adds a TGUI version of player panel. It should have all of the features of the current player panel, with some additional "most used" buttons on the main player panel. Ideally, if all goes well, I'd like to phase out the older player panel, but this will need extensive testing.
