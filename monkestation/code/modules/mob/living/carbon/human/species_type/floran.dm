	return "Plant-based humanoids, they are extremely violent carnivores with no central government or power structure, \
	split into numerous tribes spread across the universe, each led by a Greenfinger. \
	Though they are biologically a single-sex race, they may adapt sexually dimorphic physical traits and male/female identities if they so choose. \
	Their speech is often simplistic, and they tend to hisss their sibilantsss. \
	Their primary drives are hunting, acquiring trophies, fighting, eating meat, and more hunting. \
	It is speculated that their general casual view towards killing and consuming other intelligent species stems from not viewing \"meat\" as \"alive\" in \
	the same sense they are. However, as the Floran spread throughout the galaxy, more and more individuals are recognizing a need to integrate, \
	make friends, and maybe not stab anyone that slightly inconveniences them. (E.I. THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO RDM)"
