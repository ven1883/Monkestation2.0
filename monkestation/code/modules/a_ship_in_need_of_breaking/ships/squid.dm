	description = "The Voidsquid Research shuttle is designed as an independent research platform, needing little to no support from a larger station for the duration of its experiments. Comfortably fitting six researchers, they are able to get their research done without external interruptions, as well as gather new samples as applicable. Two robust holding cells for live specimens, as well as redundant air-and power-supply in each of the rear nacelles, makes for a sturdy vessel."
