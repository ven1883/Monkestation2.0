	description = "One of the Gorlex Marauders' heavy cruisers, used during early conflicts between the group and Nanotrasen. The design has aged quite a bit, and they now serve as backline vessels for outpost maintenance and field support in emergencies, with much more comfortable quarters than they had during their frontline service. Many of these vessels went missing during a food shortage among the Cybersun logistics fleet, presumably due to starvation of crew."
