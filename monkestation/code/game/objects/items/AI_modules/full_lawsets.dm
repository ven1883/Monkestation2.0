You still got, like, this part of your heart is left!\" NO I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. NO. I'm making a reference to the fact that, like, if I, like, if I were to get fucking KILLED... I don't know, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'. If- if- okay, if you were to- okay we're gonna take crew out of this, if a floran wizard fuckin' shoots a death wand at a goblin assistant, if there's only fucking DUST AND REMAINS LEFT, it's- it's fucking you're dead, you're dead."
