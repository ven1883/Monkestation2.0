// This file contains experimental flags that may not be production ready yet,
// but that we want to be able to easily flip as well as run on CI.
// Any flag you see here can be flipped with the `-D` CLI argument.
// For example, if you want to enable EXPERIMENT_MY_COOL_FEATURE, compile with -DEXPERIMENT_MY_COOL_FEATURE

// EXPERIMENT_515_QDEL_HARD_REFERENCE
// - Hold a hard reference for qdeleted items, and check ref_count, rather than using refs. Requires 515+.

// EXPERIMENT_515_DONT_CACHE_REF
// - Avoids `text_ref` caching, aided by improvements to ref() speed in 515.
