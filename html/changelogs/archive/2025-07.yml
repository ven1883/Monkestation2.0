  Absolucy:
  - balance: Burning yellow extracts no longer electrocute and deal damage, instead
      they cause painful disorientation for a few seconds.
  - balance: Burning metal extracts now just applies and ignites thermite to adjacent
      walls, instead of instantly deleting them.
  - rscadd: Blood Brothers is no longer a conversion antag.
  - rscdel: Midround BBs are gone, mostly because I have no clue how to make those
      work properly midround when you need at least 2 people to sign up.
  - balance: Tweaked the weights for antags that might spawn alongside roundstart
      BBs, for variety's sake.

      other hand.

      by a heretic.
  - bugfix: Tracking a target who's beheaded or an oozeling core using your living
      heart as a heretic will now actually show the brain/core sprite, instead of
      nothing at all.
  Absolucy, Mothblocks:
  - balance: Instead of too much damage to the head beheading someone, it will now
      split their skull in half. While their skull is open, you can rip out their
      eyes with your hands. and they will spill their brain out of their head if they
      slip. Zombies can still be beheaded, though.
  - rscadd: You can right click on a dead body using a sharp weapon while targeting
      their head to decapitate them after a short delay, though. More powerful weapons
      do this quicker - a double-bladed energy sword is faster than a normal energy
      sword, which itself is still faster than a circular saw.
  - balance: The Path of Blades ascension will accept either a beheaded person, or
      someone with their skull split open.

      based on the reagent's volume (1% per 5 units).
  - balance: Infusing seeds now causes damage. The total volume of reagents in the
      beaker will inflict a base amount of damage to the seed (0.1 damage per unit
      of reagent). Seeds can be destroyed if they take too much damage.
